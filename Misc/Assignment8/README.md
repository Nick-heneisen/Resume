- `Ft`: 2.0/2
- `B`: 1.0/1
- `Bt`: 2.0/2
- `x`: 1.0/1
- `xt`: 3.0/3

- `balance`: 2/2
- `balance_rec`: 6/6

- `gsf_close`: 2/2
- `gsf`: 2/2
- `g`: 4/4

- `occurs_w`: 2/2

## Docstrings and Comments (9/20 pts)
Student's functions all have properly formatted docstrings in the right place. You loose 1.5 point for each function that doesn't have proper docstrings or comment.

‚Äç- Problem 1: 4/8
- Problem 2: 1.5/3
- Problem 3: 2/4.5
- Problem 4: 1/3
- Problem 5: 0.5/1.5

TA Comments: These docstrings are unacceptable at this stage in the class. All you are telling me is the data type of the parameters and the output. You MUST tell me more about them.


## Code Review & style (40/40 pts)
Your code is reviewed for proper style and legibility.
If your code passes the autograder, but you violated the specifications (for example using forbidden python features/functions), you will lose the autograder points as well!
